        <ul style = "display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
          <li>
            <h3>Scrolling Issues</h3>
            <p>The semester view does not scroll correctly while you are dragging classes
              into it. We are working to fix this.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Open Search on Click</h3>
            <p>The search bar sometimes fails to open when you click on it.  This seems to be
              computer/browser-dependent, and we are investigating.  It should always open
              when you start typing to search for a class.
